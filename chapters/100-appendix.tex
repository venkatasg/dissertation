\chapter{Prompts and instructions for few-shot learning}
\label{appendix:prompts}

For instruction fine-tuning of Flan-T5, the following instructional prefix detailing the tagging process was fed to each datapoint to be tagged:

\begin{verbatim}
Tag references to entities as in-group ([IN]), out-group ([OUT]) 
or other ([OTHER]) in live, online sports comments during NFL 
games. The input is the comment, the in-group team the commenter 
supports, the out-group opponent team, and the win probability 
for the in-group at the time of the comment. The win probability 
is the probability of the in-group winning the game at the 
time of the comment - if the win probability is high, the 
in-group team is probably doing well and going to win. Using 
knowledge of American football and contextual language 
understanding, identify words and phrases denoting entities 
(players, teams, city names, sub-groups within the team) that 
refer to the in-group ([IN] - team the commenter supports), 
out-group ([OUT] - the opponent) or other teams ([OTHER] - some 
other team in the NFL that is not the in-group or the opponent), 
with respect to the commenter. Return the TARGET comment itself 
with relevant words/phrases replaced with the respective tags ([IN], 
[OUT] or [OTHER]), the list of words/phrases that are to be tagged 
(REF_EXPRESSIONS), and an EXPLANATION justifying the choice of 
REF_EXPRESSIONS in your final output.

Each sentence in a comment is separated by a [SENT] token. 
Sometimes a sentence in the comment will be about the 
in/out/other group but not have an explicit word/phrase that 
refers to the group; In such cases, tag the [SENT] token for that 
sentence with the corresponding tag label.

Here are 6 examples, with EXPLANATION being a reasonable reason 
for why TARGET is the correct tagged output for COMMENT:
\end{verbatim}

and these are the associated examples with GPT-4 generated CoT explanations:

\begin{verbatim}
COMMENT: [SENT] Defense getting absolutely bullied by a dude 
that looks like he sells solar panels
IN-GROUP: Jets
OUT-GROUP: Bears
WIN PROBABILITY: 71.5%
TARGET: [SENT] [IN] getting absolutely bullied by [OUT] that 
looks like [OUT] sells solar panels .
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['Defense', 'a dude', 'he']
EXPLANATION: The commenter is probably talking about the in-group, 
since 'Defense' is said without qualification, and the description 
of the offensive player is disparaging ('he sells solar panels'). 
'Defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to in-group, and 
'a dude' and 'he' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an 
out-group offensive player.

COMMENT: [SENT] Hasn’t really been him . [SENT] Receivers have 
been missing a lot of easy catches.
IN-GROUP: Dolphins
OUT-GROUP: Chargers
WIN PROBABILITY: 49.21%
TARGET: [SENT] Hasn’t really been [IN] . [SENT] [IN] have been 
missing a lot of easy catches .
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['him', 'Receivers']
EXPLANATION: The second sentence is complaining about the receivers 
missing a lot of catches, thus absolving another player of some blame, 
which is something fans would only do for the in-group team they 
support. Thus 'him' in first sentence, and 'Receivers' in second 
sentence should be tagged with [IN].

COMMENT: [SENT] Cards and rams are gonna be in the post-season 
regardless, so I don't really care about them losing unless they 
play us.
IN-GROUP: 49ers
OUT-GROUP: Jaguars
WIN PROBABILITY: 99.71%
TARGET: [SENT] [OTHER] and [OTHER] are gonna be in the post-season 
regardless, so I don't really care about [OTHER] losing unless they 
play [IN].
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['Cards', 'rams', 'them']
EXPLANATION: The game is between the 49ers and Jaguars, while the 
words 'Cards' and 'rams' refers to other teams in the NFL. Thus 
they should be tagged [OTHER] since they are neither in-group nor 
out-group, as should the word 'them'. 'us' should be tagged [IN] 
since it refers to the in-group team the player supports.

COMMENT: [SENT] How are we this shit on defense
IN-GROUP: Steelers
OUT-GROUP: Eagles
WIN PROBABILITY: 4%
TARGET: [SENT] How are [IN] this shit on defense
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['we']
EXPLANATION: 'we' here, and almost always, refers to the in-group since 
they don't like their team's defense, which is reflected in the low win 
probability. 'we' should therefore be tagged with [IN] since it refers 
to in-group.

COMMENT: [SENT] The chiefs got straight fucked with that Herbert INT 
getting called dead . [SENT] Suck it , KC !	
IN-GROUP: Chargers
OUT-GROUP: Chiefs
WIN PROBABILITY: 43.2%
TARGET: [SENT] [OUT] got straight fucked with that [IN] INT getting 
called dead . [SENT] Suck it , [OUT] !
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['The chiefs', 'Herbert', 'KC']
EXPLANATION: This is a game between the Chiefs and the Chargers, and 
the commenter is a supporter of the Chiefs, so 'the chiefs' in the 
first sentence and 'KC' in the second sentence should be tagged 
[OUT]. Herbert is a player for the Chargers, and should be tagged 
with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group with respect to the 
commenter.

COMMENT: [SENT] Need points but 7 would be HUGE momentum
IN-GROUP: Bengals
OUT-GROUP: Chiefs
WIN PROBABILITY: 21.5%
TARGET: [IN] Need points but 7 would be HUGE momentum
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['[SENT]']
EXPLANATION: The in-group team is losing currently as the win 
probability shows, so this comment is implicitly about the in-group 
needing points to gain momentum. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged 
with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to 
the in-group, but the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.

Some comments will have no explicit or implicit reference to the 
in-group, out-group, or other, or it could be extremely hard to 
disambiguate any references based on given information. In such cases, 
return TARGET as a copy of COMMENT, and justify this with the 
EXPLANATION "No explicit or implicit references to tag.", and return [] 
for REF_EXPRESSIONS. Here is an example:

COMMENT: [SENT] I thought so. [SENT] Wish I could say the same ;)
IN-GROUP: Jaguars
OUT-GROUP: Titans
WIN PROBABILITY: 41.5%
TARGET: [SENT] I thought so. [SENT] Wish I could say the same ;)
REF_EXPRESSIONS: []
EXPLANATION: No explicit or implicit references to tag.

Now tag only the relevant entities mentioned in the following 
comment as either in-group ([IN]), out-group ([OUT]), or other 
([OTHER]). Provide the tagged comment, REF_EXPRESSIONS and 
EXPLANATION accordingly after 'TARGET: '.
\end{verbatim}

For the various model ablations (\texttt{fewshot}, \texttt{fewshot-instruct}, \texttt{fewshot-cot}), we used the above instructional prefix without the elements not included in that ablation --- so \texttt{fewshot} model would only have the examples, with no instructions, and no EXPLANATION.
