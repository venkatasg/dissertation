\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep=\baselineskip
    \item We need to look at references --- does the intergroup bias influence how we \textbf{refer} to different groups?\pause
    \item Probing suffered from utilizing two dimensions derived from the utterance --- can we tie the utterance to a \textbf{non-linguistic description of events} preceding/precipitating the utterance?\pause
    \item How do we obtain language data with labelled intergroup information \textbf{at scale}?

    \textbf{Win Probability} (\textbf{WP}) is the probability of the in-group winning at a point in time. It is updated live with the game, with each play.\pause

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Gold annotation dataset}

I annotated 1500 (random) comments for in-group, out-group (and other) by selecting spans from comments that correspond to these different groups. In addition to the comment, I was given the \textbf{live score}, source subreddit, and opponent.

\vspace{\baselineskip}\pause

\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep=\baselineskip
    \item 1500 comments from 768 threads and 491 games.\pause
    \item 1393 [IN] tags, 266 [OUT] tags, 166 [OTHER] tags.\pause

People talk about the game, and refer to in-group/out-group in different ways. Does this change systematically with WP?

%     [OUT] sells solar panels .
%     REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['Defense', 'a dude', 'he']
%     EXPLANATION: The commenter is probably talking about the in-group, 
%     since 'Defense' is said without qualification, and the description 
%     of the offensive player is disparaging ('he sells solar panels'). 
%     'Defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to in-group, and 
%     'a dude' and 'he' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an 
%     out-group offensive player.

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Modeling takeaways}

\textbf{Never bet against size (or GPT)}. I'm currently working towards finetuning Mistral.

\pause\vfill

Modeling accuracy is \textbf{independent of WP} --- most of the low performance on out-group is low recall. We can make inferences on a representative sample of comments labelled with in-group and out-group tags.

\pause\vfill

In analysis presented from now, I tagged over 200,000 randomly sampled comments using \texttt{fewshot+instruct+cot} model.

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Reduction in reference frequency}
    The better the state of affairs in the real world for the \emph{in-group}, the more likely commenters are to \textbf{abstract away} from specifically referring to the in-group (or any group). \pause

    Fans band together to talk about the in-group with \textbf{third person plural referents} the less likely they are to win:

    \ex. \a. \alert{We} need a reliable safety ….. like , BAD .

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]\frametitle{Kick the out-group when they're down}

    Fans prefer to talk (shit) about the out-group, and refer less to the in-group, when the in-group is doing well:
    
    \ex. \a.  Keep going , hang 50 on \alert{these fuckers}.
         \b. ``Karma will get the Cowboys for trying to run up the score'' Actual comment in \alert{the Falcons} sub , tells you all you need to know about \alert{the pussies} over there.
